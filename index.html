    <h1>Police Shootings</h1>
    <p>
      Police wrongdoings have always been tried to be shushed up. In 1994 congress was ordered by the Atorny General to publish annual statistics on police use of excessive force; this was never carried out. Many different groups have tired to track these killings and compile lists so that this information will not be continuously shushed up. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_United_States'>Wikipedia </a>and other online channels have tried to make these wrongdoings public.
